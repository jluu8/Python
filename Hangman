Create a program that selects a random word and then allows the user to guess it in a game of hangman.
Like the real game, there should be blank spots for each letter in the word, and a part of the body should be added each time the user guesses a letter than is not in the answer.
You may choose how many wrong turns the user can make until the game ends.
Subgoals:
If the user loses, print out the word at the end of the game.
Create a "give up" option. (Did not do)
